Sample Tutorial (quick “build”)

Step 1 — Model your domain
--------------------------
Create:

Customer
BankAccount (base)
CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount
Transaction
Keep fields private, add getters, and use constructors for initialization.

Step 2 — Enforce rules centrally
--------------------------------
Put all business rules in BankService:
validate amount
check funds
record transactions

Step 3 — Make the UI dumb
------------------------
BankApp should only:
print menus
read user input
call BankService
display results

Step 4 — Add transaction logging
--------------------------------
Every deposit/withdraw/transfer should create a Transaction object and store it in an ArrayList.

Step 5 — Test with scripts
--------------------------
Use a few “known-good” input scenarios:
deposit 100, withdraw 40 → balance 60
Withdraw 100 from balance 50 → reject
transfer 25 from checking to savings → both balances correct

Step 6 — Add one extension
-------------------------
Pick one:
PIN lockout after 3 failures
Savings interest
Monthly checking fee
File persistence
