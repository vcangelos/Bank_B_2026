“A Small Banking App That Teaches Good Java Habits”

Most student projects fail for one reason: they mix UI, business rules, and data in one giant main() method. 
This bank simulation fixes that by using a clean separation:

Model layer: Customer, BankAccount, Transaction
Service layer: BankService (single place for rules)
App layer: BankApp (menu + input only)

That structure is intentionally “enterprise-like” without being heavy. The payoff is immediate:

rules are consistent (validation happens once)
features are easier to add (e.g., interest, fees, persistence)
testing becomes straightforward (you can test BankService without the console UI)

Transactions are treated as first-class records. 
Instead of just changing balance, the app also writes a Transaction entry, 
which means you can always explain why a balance changed—exactly the kind of 
traceability real systems need.

If you only skim one thing: keep the console UI dumb and put all logic in BankService.
